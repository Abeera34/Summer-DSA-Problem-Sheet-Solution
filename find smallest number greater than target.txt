744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.

Note that the letters wrap around.

For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.
 

Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Example 2:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Example 3:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
Output: "f"
 

Constraints:

2 <= letters.length <= 104
letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
letters contains at least two different characters.
target is a lowercase English letter.


SOLUTION:-
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int lo = 0, hi = letters.size();
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mi=lo+(hi-lo)/2;
            if (letters[mi]<= target) 
                lo=mi+1;
            else 
                hi=mi;
        }
        return letters[lo % letters.size()];
    }
};
